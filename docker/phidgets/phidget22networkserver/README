                     Phidget22 Network Server
                           Version 1.16
				  
Installation
============

	./configure && make && make install
	
For a default configuration:

	mkdir -p /etc/phidgets
	cp files/etc/phidgets/* /etc/phidgets/
	
Requirements
============

	libphidget22
	libphidget22extra

	Avahi client library
	
 For Phidget server publish support, Avahi is required, along with
 the Avahi client library. This is usually a package called 
 libavahi-client or similar.

Usage
=====

   'phidget22networkserver -h' to see options.


Configuration
=============

 The configuration file is located in /etc/phidgets by default and
 is named phidget22networkserver.pc.

 Review the configuration file along side this document for context.
 In most cases, the server will run with reasonable defaults if a
 block, or element is undefined.

 The file format follows a basic structure with named blocks and
 key value pair elements.
 
 A block is named and its contents are enclosed in braces:

 	blockname { contents }

An element is named followed by the value:

	elementname : value

Values can be strings, boolean, numbers or lists.
Strings are quoted with either single or double quotes.

	a: token
	b: 'a string'
	c: "another string"
	d: true
	e: false
	f: 1
	g: 1.1
	h: [ 'str', 6, false ]


Each major feature or subsystem of the server is located within its
own block.

	<auth>
		Contains the password (if any) required by clients to
		connect to the server.

	<logging>
		Controls the default log level, the number of log files to
		keep before deleting and the maximum size of the log files.

		<network>
			Enables and specifies the port number for the phidget
			network log server.

		<source>
			Allows fine control of the various log sources.
			Sources whose names begins with '_' are not affected by
			the global log level.

	<network>

		<sync>
			Specifies how often config key changes are written out, 
			in seconds. Defaults to 5.

Keepalives
==========

 The network server verifies it's connection to clients periodically
 via keepalives. It sends a keepalive message to each client at a set
 interval, and expects to hear back from the client within a set
 interval. If the server does not hear back, it will close the
 connection to that client, as well as closing any opened Phidget
 channels that are no longer in use. This is a safety feature designed
 to reset devices to their off-state when a connection goes bad.
 
 The default server keepalive time is 4000ms (4 seconds). This
 guarantees that channels will be closed with 4 to 8 seconds after
 a connection goes bad - up to 4 seconds for the keepalive interval, 
 and 4 seconds for the keepalive timeout.
 
 The server-side keepalive time can be configured in the server
 config file, in the network block like so:
 
	network {
		keepalive: 4000
	}
	
 Keepalives can be disabled by setting the keepalive time to 0 in the
 server config file. However, keep in mind that if no traffic is 
 going over the network connection, a loss of connection may NEVER
 be detected - for example a digital input or output that isn't 
 changing does not produce any network traffic. Even with traffic,
 it can take 60 seconds or more to detect a bad connection.
 
 Network clients also have a keepalive. After receiving a keepalive
 message, the client expects to keep receiving keepalives within a
 set deadline. If a keepalive is not received, the client closes the
 connection and detaches all Phidget channels opened by the user. If
 a keepalive message is never received (because keepalives are 
 disabled on the server), the client keepalive is never activated.
 
 The default client keepalive is 8000ms (8 seconds). This guarantees
 that channels are detached within 8 seconds of a connection going
 bad. The client keepalive should always be 2x the server keepalive
 because the server keepalive is used to the interval and timeout,
 and the client keepalive is a combination of server interval and 
 timeout.
 
 The client keepalive can be configured via an API call like so:
 
	PhidgetNet_setProperty("keepalive", "%d", 4000);
	
 Currently, PhidgetNet_setProperty() is only exposed in the C API.
 
 Keepalives can sometimes cause unwanted behaviour - especially when
 a network is not very stable, or client or server machines are going
 to sleep, etc. It's recommended to handle attach and detach events
 in case keepalives disconnects happen. The client will automatically
 reconnect to the server, but the state of all channels willl have
 been reset to defaults. If you are seeing keepalive errors in either
 the server of client side log files, consider what may be the cause.
 It may make sense to disable keepalives if it isn't critical to
 reset devices when a connection goes bad.
 

Dictionaries
============

 A Phidget dictionary is a virtual device channel that contains
 key value pairs.  Dictionaries must be created by the server.

 A dictionary is created by placing a configuration file that
 describes the dictionary in the dictionary directory.  By default
 the dictionary directory is /etc/phidgets/dictionary.d on UNIX,
 c:\ProgramData\Phidgets\dictionary.d on Windows and
 /Library/Preferences/Phidget22NetworkServer/dictionary.d on macOS.
 
 Dictionary config files must end with the ".dpc" extension.

	dictionary {
		enabled: true
		label: <Dictionary Device Label>
		sn: <Dictionary Serial Number> # >= 1000
		config {
			key {
				<keyname> {
					value: <value>
				}
			}
		}
		log {
			key {
				<keyname> {
					enabled: true
 					interval {
 						min: <minimum update interval>
 					}
				}
			}
		}
	}

 A dictionary configuration file contains at least a config block
 with a child key block made up of one block for each key in
 the dictionary.

 When the server starts it creates a virtual dictionary device
 for each file found in the dictionary directory.  The device
 will be assigned the label and serial number from the configuration
 file.

 Each key in the config.key block is added to the dictionary.

Dictionary Store
================

 The dictionary store server monitors dictionaries for changes
 and updates config.key blocks when an update occurs.

 The purpose of the dictionary store is to allow user systems to
 define configuration key value pairs that can be accessed by
 software using the Phidget API.  When the configuration is
 altered by the software, the dictionary store will receive an
 event and store the configuration change back to the dictionary
 configuration.

 If the config key has defined 'update' as false, changes to the
 dictionary will not cause the change to be persisted.  When the
 network server restarts, the original value will be restored.

 By default keys that are added to the dictionary, but are not
 already in the dictionary config, will not cause the dictionary
 configuration to change.  The 'add' flag may be set to 'true',
 which will cause the dictionary store to persist new keys to
 the configuration.

 By default keys that are removed from the dictionary are not
 removed from the configuration.  If the config key has defined
 'remove' as true, the removal will be persisted to the
 configuration.

 	dictionary {
 		enabled: true
 		label: 'Example'
 		sn: 1000
 		generation: 'user generation' # defaults to 'default'
 		add: false
 		config {
 			key {
 				pi {
 					update: false
 					remove: false
 					value: 3.141592654
 				}
 				radius {
 					remove: true
 					value: 30
 				}
 			}
 		}
 	}

 Updates to config keys cause the previous value to be overwritten,
 and are intended to store state.  In order to support logging of
 changes, log keys can be used.

 dictionary {
 	enabled: true
 	label: 'Example'
 	sn: 1000
 	log {
 		key {
 			temperature {
				enabled: true
			}
 		}
 	}
 }

 When the dictionary store receives an update event for a log
 key, a record is written to the log database.  The log record
 contains a unique id, the date and time of the update, a user
 defined generation value, and the key and value.

 The rate that updates are logged can be controlled by the
 dictionary configuration.

 	dictionary {
 		log {
 			key {
 				temp {
 					interval {
 						min: 30 # store not more than 1 per 30 sec
 					}
 				}
 			}
 		}
 	}
	
 Note that config blocks cannot be empty, so a log key that does
 not specify any settings must at least specify 'enabled: true'

 Log data can be queried from the network server www interface
 by performing an HTTP GET at /api/v1/dictionary?dictserial=<serial>
 
 This API must be enabled in the dictionary config by setting
 'phidget.feature.dictionary.webapi.enabled' to 'true'

 The following would return all the log records from the Example
 dictionary for the key 'temp'.  The data format is JSON.

 http://servername:port/api/v1/dictionary?dictserial=1000&key=temp

 Additional query parameters include:

 	gen=<the generation>
 	startid: id >= given number
 	endid: id <= given number
 	startdate: log date >= given date (ISO8601)
 	enddate: log date <= given date (ISO8601)
